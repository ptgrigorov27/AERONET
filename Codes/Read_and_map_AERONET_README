# Read and Map AERONET

The purpose of this code is to read and map AERONET data directly from AERONET's web services. Such data includes
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements taken with different wavelengths, as well as Angstrom Exponent parameters. Different
parameters can be specified by user such as geographical bounds, daily/hourly averages, wavelength, time frame, etc.
The output of the code is geographical maps with circle markers and colorbar representing the average aerosol parameters 
at a given day or hour. The main use of this tool is to track the movement and density of aerosols over time. This tool
was first deployed in June 2023 in mapping the aerosols produced by the Canadian wildfires. Users also have the opportunity
to save and download the output maps as an image file at the end.

## Getting Started

Running this code is straightforward. The only requirements are having the means to run a Python notebook file
(.ipynb). This can be done either in Google Colab, if the user has a Google account. It can also be done locally on
Jupyter Notebook, which requires installation of Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/

### Prerequisites

There is a list of libraries that need to be installed before running the code. Those include: cartopy, beautifulsoup4,
shapely, requests, and geopandas. All other libraries used are already installed on Google Colab/Anaconda by default.
Note that the exclamation point is not required when installing through Anaconda command prompt.

!pip install cartopy
!pip install --no-binary shapely shapely --force
!pip install beautifulsoup4
!pip install requests
!pip install geopandas

The Cartopy package is designed to make it easy to draw maps for data analysis and visualisation. The shapely package is 
useful for manipulation of planar geometric objects in order to create different map projections. The two projections used
by this tool are PlateCarree and Orthographic. The beautifulsoup4 package provides web scraping capabilities, where data
from a webpage can be read into "soup" file that can be later converted to a dataframe.
